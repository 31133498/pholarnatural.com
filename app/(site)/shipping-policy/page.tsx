      <h2>Processing time</h2>
      <p>
        Orders are picked, packed and handed to the carrier within 1–2 business days. Orders placed
        on a weekend or public holiday begin processing the next business day. You will receive an
        email when the parcel is dispatched.
      </p>

      <h2>Shipping rates</h2>
      <p>
        Shipping rates are based on your destination country and are shown at checkout before you pay.
      </p>

      <h2>Domestic — Canada</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Standard rate shown at checkout</li>
        <li>Transit time: 3–7 business days after dispatch</li>
        <li>Remote and northern postal codes may take longer</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>International</h2>
      <p>
        We ship worldwide. Transit times below are after dispatch and exclude time held in customs.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>United States: 7–10 business days</li>
        <li>United Kingdom and EU: 7–14 business days</li>
        <li>Rest of world: 10–21 business days</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Final international rates are still being confirmed with our carriers.</strong> Until
        they are published here, the rate you are charged at checkout is the rate that applies to
        your order — it will not change afterwards.
      </p>

      <h3>Customs, duties and import taxes</h3>
      <p>
        Duties and import taxes are set by the destination country and are not included in the price
        you pay us. They are the recipient&apos;s responsibility and are collected by the carrier or
        customs authority on delivery.
      </p>

      <h2>Incorrect addresses</h2>
      <p>
        Please check your address carefully at checkout. If a parcel is returned to us because the
        address was incomplete or incorrect, we will contact you to arrange redelivery; the second
        shipping charge is payable by you.
      </p>

      <h2>Lost or damaged parcels</h2>
      <p>
        If your order arrives damaged, email us within 48 hours of delivery with your order number
        and a photo, and we will replace it at no cost. If tracking shows no movement for 10 business
        days, contact us and we will open an investigation with the carrier.
