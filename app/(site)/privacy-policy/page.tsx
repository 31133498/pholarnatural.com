      <h2>What we collect</h2>
      <p>We only collect what we need to sell you a product or hold your appointment.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Order information</strong> — name, email, shipping address, and the items you
          bought.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Booking information</strong> — name, email, optional phone number, and the service,
          date and time you selected.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Contact form submissions</strong> — name, email, subject and message.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Usage data</strong> — anonymous statistics about which pages are visited, only if
          you accept analytics cookies.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We do <strong>not</strong> collect or store card details. Payments are handled entirely by
        Stripe and card data never reaches our servers.
      </p>

      <h2>Why we collect it</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>To fulfil and deliver your order, and to email you its confirmation</li>
        <li>To confirm, remind you about, or amend your appointment</li>
        <li>To answer your questions when you contact us</li>
        <li>To understand which parts of the site work, so we can improve them</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We do not sell your personal data, and we never have.</p>

      <h2>Cookies</h2>
      <p>You control non-essential cookies through the banner shown on your first visit.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Essential</strong> — remember your cart and keep checkout secure. These cannot be
          switched off, because the site cannot function without them.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Analytics</strong> — anonymous page-level statistics. Off unless you accept.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Marketing</strong> — used to measure campaigns. Off unless you accept.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Your cart is stored in your own browser&apos;s local storage, not on our servers. Clearing
        your browser data clears your cart.
      </p>

      <h2>Who we share data with</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Stripe</strong> — payment processing. Stripe receives the payment details and the
          order amount.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Our email provider</strong> — to send order and booking confirmations.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Shipping carriers</strong> — the delivery address, so your parcel can reach you.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Each of these receives only what it needs to do its job, and nothing more.</p>

      <h2>How long we keep it</h2>
      <p>
        Order and booking records are kept for seven years, because tax and accounting rules require
        it. Contact messages are kept for two years. Analytics data is retained for 14 months.
      </p>

      <h2>Your rights</h2>
      <p>You can ask us to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Give you a copy of the personal data we hold about you</li>
        <li>Correct anything that is wrong</li>
        <li>Delete your data, where we are not legally required to keep it</li>
        <li>Stop sending you marketing, at any time</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Email <a href={`mailto:${BUSINESS.email}`}>{BUSINESS.email}</a> and we will respond within 30
        days.
      </p>

      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>
        The site is served over HTTPS and payment processing is delegated to Stripe, a PCI-DSS Level
        1 provider. No system is perfectly secure, but we do not hold the data that would be most
        damaging to lose.
